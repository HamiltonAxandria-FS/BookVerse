## Topic - Wireframes

This document contains general notes related to wireframes and why they are useful and some downfalls related to them.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Why Wireframes are Useful
Wireframes are great for setting up the visual of the project. They are like the blueprints of a house and show where all the features will be located.

* Wireframes save time on the project: This keeps everyone on the team on the same page about the design, how it should look, function and work. It also helps to prevent changes in the future since all the editing is done during the wireframe process.
* Wireframes allow for clarification for clients: Clients do not always understand big tech words or phrases, so this step in the process can help explain how their site will look and function before it is being created to help prevent any miscommunication.
* Priortizes useability: This is important because it gives everyone on the team a good look at how well the site flows and how easy it will be for a user. This will save time later in the coding process if there are useability issues that need to be fixed before coding has started.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Things to Avoid with Wireframes
Although wireframes have many useful aspects there are still some downfalls and things to avoid to make using them all the better. 

* Full Design: This is something to avoid when using a wireframe. Wireframes are used to map out the layout and functionality of the site not the design aspect. It takes away from the purporse of the tool.
* Mapping out every page: Although wireframes are great for mapping out what the site will look and function like, everypage and every detail does not need to be part of it. It is important to just add the necessary pages and functions.
* Not getting feedback: This would be very harmful to the whole project if you build a wireframe and do not get feedback from the client. Feedback is an important part of wireframing to clarifiy any miscommunication and giving room to change things as needed.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Steps to make a great Wireframe
After researching the best ways to make a great Wireframe, I decided on the top 3 best tips to make that happen. 

* Focus on user/clients needs: This step is important because in order to please the client and make a site that a user will enjoy or find easy to use, their needs need to be put first. Keep the things they ask for in mind the whole project. It all starts with the client and user.
* Follow UI design patterns: UI design patterns are already tested out and are a great way to make a good site. Following one that will fit the clients wants and needs will also help the developers when coding. 
* Gather Feedback: Feeback will be one of the best things to get at this stage in development. Fixing issues in design or functionality at this stage will save time and money later on in the project. It also insures that all parties are happy with how the site should turn out.

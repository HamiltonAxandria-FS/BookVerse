## Topic - Workflow

Workflow can be described as all of the steps and processes it takes to build a website. It can be broken down into three phases: Planning, Implementation and Testing/Launch.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Branches

I reviewed the importance of branches and why they are used. I learned why it is not best practice to use only the main branch when working on a team of developers and how to keep the code organized before it is ready to be launched.

* Featured Branch workflow is the best practice when working on team of developers. It makes it easier for each developer to stay organized with what they are doing and what other are doing without overlapping work or missing important steps.

* Break each part of the project into its own branch. For example, if there is research that needs to be done open a research branch. Again, this helps keep all the code organized and clean.

* Wait to push the code from the featured branch into the main branch until all the work is done and ready to be launched. Code from the featured branches can be pushed to a dev or staged branch when completed but not ready to be launched.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 2 - Pull Requests

I dove a little deeper into why pull requests were an option. I knew how to use them, but I did not understand the importance of them until this research. I leaned why and how they can be efficient in a team environment and how important they really are to workflow.

* Pull requests are important so that other developers can view the request and make any changes they need to before accepting the request.

* Code review is the benefit of having pull requests because it keeps everyone on the team accountable and gives the developer requesting the pull a second set of eyes on their code.

* Pull requests also make featured branch workflow possible because each person on a team can work on their own branch then do a pull request to merge all their work into one branch later on. This is another example of how a team can keep their code organized.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Why workflow is important

After researching the importance of branches and pull requests and knowing that workflow is important because it keeps everyone on a team organized, I wanted to know some other reasons it is important. I listed the top three other reasons I feel it is important for a project especially when it is a team one.

* Enhances communication: communication is one of the most important things in all aspects of life. Workflow keeps communication open for everyone. Using featured branches and pull requests is part of workflow communication so that everyone is on the same page about where each other is on the project.

* Knowledge sharing: This is another important part. Learning is something that never stops by having a strong workflow a developers can learn more from each other with strengths and weaknesses.

* Increased accountability:  workflow gives the opportunity to give each developer their own task which also gives them the accountability for their own part of the project. This also decreases micromanagement from managers.

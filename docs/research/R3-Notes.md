## Topic - Design

Design can make or break your website. It is important to find colors that complement each other and font that goes with the theme of the website.

## Sub-Topic 1 - Color
Color is an important part of design becasue it can make or break a website. There are different aspects of color and the resaonings behind each that can play a part in the feeling a site gives.

* Color Theory: Is a set of ideas that artists use to help create a feeling to their audiences. Color theory is important to web design because depending on the site the business might want to convey a certain type of feeling or vibe to their consumer. Knowing how colors make people feel is something important to know when thinking about designing a website.
  
* Color Psychology: This goes along with color theory, but color psychology is the study of how colors influence people’s emotions. Some examples are:
-red evokes a strong emotion
-orange: cheerful and confident
-blue: calm feelings 
-white: clean or neutral feelings.

* Why color is important: Color is more influential than it appears. Making sure a website has colors that are pleasing to the eye can keep users on the site longer and they have a more enjoyable experience. If a site has colors that clash or are too contrasting it can be harmful to the business. Font color and background color are a popular example. If the font color is a shade that is unreadable then the user will not be able to gain the information, they were looking for off the website. It is also important to pick colors that will influence the user to feel the way you want them too. An example would be A spa website would want to use cool calming colors instead of bright bold colors to influence their user to feel relaxed.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Font
Font is a part of desing that goes along with color. Find the the right front for the style of webstie you want is crucial to the vibe of the site. It is also important to find a font that fits well with the color scheme chosen for the site.

* Font Personality traits: Fonts are similar to colors with how they can make the audience feel. Each font family give off certain types of feelings. There are 6 basic font families that have many different styles of fonts within those. Some examples of personality traits of font families are:
Serif fonts: classic and trustworthy
Sans-Serif: modern and clean
Slab serif: bold and confident.
Script: elegant and unique
Handwritten: informal and artistic
Decorative: Stylized and dramatic

* Font libraries: Font libraries can be very helpful to developers. They make finding a font easy, save time and there are some libraries that are free to use. There are also ways you can create your own font library. Apple has a way to create your own on their computer. This would make having all the fonts that are being used on a project in one place so that it can be referred to at any time. Some other font libraries are:
Google Fonts
Font Squirrel
Font Library

* Why font is important: Font is just as important as color in almost all the same ways. Font is visual communication that influences how we interpret and perceive information. It also influences our emotions, so choosing the right font is important to consider if you want your users to feel a particular way about your website. Another thing to consider is how does the font look with the color choices. These are two parts of the design process that need to work together to give the site the vibe its going for.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Types of Web Design
It is important to choose the type of web design you want for your site before starting to code. Being educated on the different designs is important in the process to choose. I only touched on 3 types here but there are more out there to choose from based on what kind of site is being created.

* Static page layout: This is the most basic type of webpage layout. They have preset measurements that do not change. This type of layout would not work for any type of mobile site. They are not used much anymore but can be on a computer. The best thing about them is that they are easy to setup but do not give a positive user experience.

* Adaptive website layout: Adaptive layout is almost the opposite of Static page layout. This type of layout uses CSs queries to adjust the websites sizes for mobile apps and browsers. The cons of this type of layout are that it isn’t completely responsive and different device widths can cause layout issues with too much or too little space. Similar to static layout it is also easy to setup and takes less development.

* Responsive design layout: The responsive layout is the most popular currently. This is a mobile first design and will work on any browser size. Because smartphone and mobile devices are what most people use, having a responsive design layout is what should be used for most websites. Unlike the other two types discussed this layout takes more time to build and develop, because of that though, another mobile site will not have to be built.

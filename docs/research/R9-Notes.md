## Topic - Innovation

This document contains information on topics involving innovation and creativity and how this is important to the tech field.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Fair Use
Fair use is when small parts of material that is copyrighted can be used under certain circumstances.

* Fair use of a material can be used when critiquing a copyrighted work. An example of this would be when writing a news article on a material and quoting the piece of work. 
* It can also be used in a Parody. A pardoy is a piece of work that makes fun of another one, in order to do this some of the original work has to be used.
* The only way to determin if Fair use is being used properly is by going to court and having the judge decide. There are 4 factors they use to decide which are:
    - The purpose
    - The nature of the copywrited work
    - The amount taken from the material
    - The effect it has on the market.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Coders' Rights Project
This is a project designed to help protect coders so they can safely explore technology without legal challenges.

* Reverse engineering is one of the things legal regulations prevent developers from doing. Reverse engineering is how automobiles, radios and computer software has came to be.
* Vulnerability Reporting is another one. This is something that users and consumers can do without worry but developers who report are often times sent legal threats. This project is to help prevent that.
* The "Grey Hat" Guide is the last one. This is if a developer realizes they have accidently violated the law and is scared to report that to their company in case legal action is taken upon them.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Reading Accessibility
There are a few differnet forms of reading accessibility that can help people who need it. Technology has come a long way for people with disabilities.

* Text to Speech: This is a way for the disabled to listen to what is written on a webpage or text. This can help with comprehension of the text also.
* Screen Readers: Although this is similar to text to speech it is more extensive. Screen readers are more for the blind or visually impaired. It will read the entire page to someone including menu options and large texts.
* Translation tools: This is a great thing for someone who cannot speak or read a language that needs the information on a page. It would be great for tourists who do not speak the language or an immigrat that is still learning. It will translate a whole page into the lanuguage of choice.

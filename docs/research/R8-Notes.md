**Testing**

**A/B Testing:** 

**What is A/B Testing?**: A/B testing is when there are two versions of an application and they are each
tested to find the one that has the maximun impact. This is important becuase it will help tell developers how the application works in the real world. Some of the differnet things that are tested in a A/B test are page layouts, color schemes, user interfaces, and workflows.

**What can we test for:**

User interfaces: Compare two different interfaces and see which one is more effective for the user.

Landing pages: Try different designs and see which one is best preforming.

Navigation and menus: Try differnt Naviagation designs and see which one is easiest for the user to navigate the site.

Forms and sign-up flows: This can be used to try different sign up forms and see which form is more efficent for the user.

**Use Cases:** 

**What is a Use Case?:** A use case is the action preformed and the behavior from that action. It is documented and then that documentation is used to better access the application to make changes. This is all from the users perspective.

Sunny Day cases: These are the use cases that are tested when everything is working correctly and going "right".
These are the most used and high priority cases.

Rainy Day cases: These are the cases that come after the Sunny Day cases and are not as much of a priority.

**Elements that are used in Use Cases:**

- Brief description: Decribing the case.

- Actor: The Users.

- Precondition: Conditions to be Satisfied before the case begins.

- Basic Flow: The normal workflow in the system. It is the flow of transactions done by the Actors on completing 
  their goals. When the actors interact with the system, in a normal way.

- Alternate flow: This is the less common interaction done by a user with the system.

- Exception flow: The flow that prevents a user from achieving the goal.

- Post Conditions: The conditions that need to be checked after the case is completed.

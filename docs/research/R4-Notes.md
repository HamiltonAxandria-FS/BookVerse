## Topic - Design Theory

Design theory is a system that helps to properly use design to communicate a message with visuals to an audience. 
There are many different parts that go into design theory, but I will only talk about a few. 

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Laws of UX
There are 20 laws of UX design. 
These are laws to help make a successful design for a website. 
I will list 3 below that I feel are important. 

* Law of Proximity: This law states that objects that are near to each other tend to be grouped together.
  This is to help establish a relationship with nearby objects,they are perceived
 to share similar functionality and it helps users organize information faster.

* Law of Uniform Connectedness: This law states that elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.
Things can be visually connected by colors, lines, frames or other shapes. They can be visually connected by using an arrow or line to show the connection.
Uniform connectedness can also be shown to show context or emphasize a relationship between similar items.

* Law of Peak-End Rule: This law states people judge an experience based on how they felt at its peak and at its end rather than the average of the
whole experience. To find out how a user feels when using a site, the developer needs to identify the moment when the product is most helpful,
valuable or entertaining. It is important to pay attention to the most intense points and the ‘end’ moments of the user’s journey.
Another thing is to remember that a user will recall the negative experiences more clearly than the positive ones.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Creating Intuitive Web Apps
The resource I used for this subtopic was extremely helpful to understand what works for users across the board.
No matter what type of app or website it is there are some common "rules" to follow so that they have a good experince
using that site. I named a few that I thought would be important for me to remember. 

* Don’t Reinvent Patterns: It is important to use the same icons colors and placement for elements that are seen in other apps.
This means using red for errors, stop or anything negative related. Icons such as the envelope for mail, a phone for calling,
an X or close button to exit out of an app. Placement is important for things like arrows. The forward arrow button should be on the right side of the page
and the backwards button should be on the left. 

* Less is Better: Having too many features on an app can be overwhelming for the user. Having few key features that will be useful
for the site is more effective and will capture the user’s attention more efficiently.

* Focus on Target Users: Focusing on the target audience is what is going to help the app be successful. Coding and creating the site for them is
important because it’ll be easier to tailor the app to what will work for those users and not everyone. The example I saw of this was a site that uses git.
It is targeting the tech audience and not the people who don’t know anything about tech.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Principals of Web Design
The article I found for this topic is a list of 10 principals of web design. These are things to keep in mind when designing and coding a 
site for a target audience. I am listing 3 of the 10 that I think will be the most useful for my specific project.  

* Don’t Make Users Think: A web page should be self-explanatory, the user should not have a hard time navigating the page. The navigation should be clear and take the
user to exactly where they want to be on the site. If it is not clear and the user cannot figure out how to work the site, the user will leave and find a different
site to use that is easier to understand.

* Make Use of Effective Writing: Writing to the audience on the site is extremely important. Using exaggerated language or business talk will deter the user and cause them to
leave the site if that is not the usual language of the audience. Another thing that is important to keep in mind is how much text is on the site. Long paragraphs of text most
likely will not be read by the audience so keeping things short and sweet is the best way to keep their attention.

* Don’t be Afraid of the White Space: This idea can be related back to the laws of UX. Less can be more, having a site that is very cluttered and full of information can be
overwhelming to the user. Space is an important aspect of a successful layout.

[Laws of UX ](https://lawsofux.com/): This site was helpful to learn about the differnet laws of UX design, what they mean 
and the examples they gave in order to understand how I can apply some of them to my project. This helped me with sub-topic 1.

**Resource 2: Title**    
[15 Timeless Rules for Creating Intuitive Web Apps](https://designforfounders.com/web-app-ux/): I learned different tips about how to create a successful 
app that I did not think about reading this article. This article helped me with sub-topic 2.


**Resource 3: Title**      
[10 Principals of Good Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/): This site helped me narrow down the important 
principals of web design that would be most help to me for my project.

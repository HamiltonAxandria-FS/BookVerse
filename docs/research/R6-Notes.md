## Topic - Planning for production

Planning for production is the smartest way to go about a project. Having a plan can help prevent roadblocks down the line. It saves time and can save money for a company. I researched some helpful tips to plan for production and added the things that would work best for myself during this project.

## Sub-Topic 1 - Documentation
Documentation is the It helps to make sure that the project is going in the direction you actually want it to go. There are many different aspects of documentation.
 
* Why document: It helps to maintain a cleaner code along with keeping everyone who is working on the project up to date on what the code is supposed to be doing.
* Process documentation: Is a type of documentation that provides meeting notes or status reports. It also gives product requirements and roadmaps.
* Developer documentation: This is another type of documentation that gives details and instructions for developers. This type provides technical information for the day to day tasks of the project. It is a great type of documentation for testing, deploying and maintaining the software.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Atomic Design
Atomic Design is a method used to create design systems. There are 5 levels that were created to help with this. I will talk about 3 of them that will be helpful to my project.

* Organisms: The third part of the atomic design. This is where the design is actually coming together all the small parts of the project like the forms and components are put together to show what the website will look like. 
* Templates: This is where the layout starts to form and all the client will be able to see their website put together. It is a more concrete version of the site. They usually start out as a wireframe.
* Pages: This is the last part of the atomic design and it is almost the final product. This is where testing starts and small changes take place and gives the opportunity to go back to any stage and make the design how it was intended.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Best Practices
It is good to know the best practices of web development in order to avoid mistakes others have had the time to trial and error. Following these can make developing a project easier and less time consuming.

* Stick to standards: Being creative is important but the best practice is to follow industry standards of the basics. Keeping the naviagation bar the same on all pages is just one example.
* Code smartly: Every line of code should have purpose. Keep things simiple and to the point. This will help others on the team be able to read and add to the code more easily and aviod bugs.
* Small updates are best: Updaating code in small pieces is best practice because it thrives on incremental updates not huge ones. This makes it easier down the line when the UI needs updating.

# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work? 


## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

[I will use Figma to draw up my design plan. I have used this in the past and found it was a great way to show my design ideas. I would also like to explore BootStrap more as well I have not used this UI kit but have looked into it many times. It would be great to experiment with something new to help me grow in the frontend department because I feel that is my weakness.]

## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.   

[I would like to use React as my front-end framework because I am familiar with it but also need the extra practice using it since I always struggle with styling in React.]


## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

[For state management I would like to use MongoDB to store my data. I am choosing this because I find it has worked best for me in the past and I feel the most comfortable with it.]


## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose? 

[I will definitley be using Node in my project. I believe it is the most straight forward and easiest to use. I also like to pair it with express. I am the most confident with Node.]


## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

[As stated above I will use Express along with Node to complete the backend of my project. I will use express to build all of the examples stated above. I feel confident using this framework as well.]


## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

[I feel the least confident in this part of the techstack. I will need to freshen up my knowledge and practice. I will use sequelize as my database since that is the one I am most familiar with.]

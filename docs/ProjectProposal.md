# [BookVerse]

## Application Definition Statement

*A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*

[ BookVerse is a book tracking app for the reader who just wants to read. It is simple but effective to keep track of all the books a reader has read with no extra frills. Just search for the book you read and add it to your bookpage. BookVerse offers a user-friendly interface and robust features to enhance their reading experience by saving time for the actual reading.] 


## Target Market

*Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles.*

[ The Target Market of this website are readers but more specifically older readers and readers who do not want another soical media app. 

Primary Research:
Female 60 - Retired High school english teacher, avid reader: Her opinion was that she just wants to keep track of the books she has read and does not like the social media concept of some of the other sites.

Female 31 - Stay at home mom, reading as a hobby, associates degree: This stay at home mom confided in me about how the goals and challenges on the other sites cause her stress becasue they make her feel like she cannot keep up with everyone around her who is reading. Her other concern was that she did not like everyone seeing what books she has finihsed becasue they were all so similar to social media sites in that way, she wanted to keep her reading hobby as something for herself. 

Male 43 - Insurance Adjuster, Masters degree in Sociology: This persons biggest complaint was that he felt like he didn't have time to use all the features of other sites and just wanted "A log of the book I have read". 

Secondary Research:
Here is a link to an article talking about how book tracking can take the joy out of reading and how simply tracking can help bring that back: (https://dorsetbookdetective.wordpress.com/2019/09/28/tracking-your-reading-is-it-worth-it/)

## User Profile / Persona

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*


[ Name: Sara Smith  
  Age: 35  
  Occupation: English Teacher  
  Location: Charlotte, NC  
  Background: Sara is a High school english teacher that has been teaching for 12 years. She is also a mom of two. Reading is an important part of her life. She loves to log her books in her current app but feels like she doesn't have time to use the other features with her demanding job and taking care of her family. She wants something simple and effective that is for her eyes only not another social media app.]


## Use Cases

*A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used.*

*Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This [article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/) gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing.*

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

[ The problem my target market is seeing is that they want a simple site that will track their books without all the extra features. Most readers want to keep track of what they read without having the extra things like ratings, statistics, comments and 'likes' from other people and anything else another reading site has that is not straight forward for keeping track of books. ]


## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

[ After interviewing friends and coworkers this week, their main pain points were that the reading sites they use are more like a social media page than a book tracking app. This is what I am trying to solve. They did not like the comments and 'likes' on their page and the statistics in some sites. Another issues one person brought to my attention was they felt overwhelmed with the goals and reading challenges of some sites which took the joy out of reading for her.]

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

[ To solve the issues above, I plan on making the site very simple and straight forward. I will have a way to search for books by title or author, A way to add that book to a profile or book page, then have a profile page with someones personal reading information. I will not add the reading challenges, ratings, or stastistics to this app so that it stays true to a simple book tracking app.]

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

[The compelting products that exist in the same market as this application are Goodreads and Storygraph. These are other book apps that are very popular with the reading community. Goodreads is a book tracking app that uses star ratings for the user to rate the books they read. Storygraph is similar but also has the aspect of giving more indepth reading data back to the user about their individual reading habits. BookVerse will be similar to these but will be a simplified version. This application is being created for the reader who just wants to track what they have read and does not want all the data and ratings of the other apps. ]


## Features & Functionality

*Define key features and functionality intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key items should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points.*

*A good way to identify a Key Feature is to use the phrase 'In order to [solve this problem] I need to [do this]'. For example, 'In order to listen to music while I workout I need to be able to create a playlist'.*

*Features and functionality should be prioritized based on their importance to the user. This will help you focus on the most important features first and then add additional features as time allows.*

[In order to find a book I need to be able to 'search' it from the API. In order to track the books I've read I need to be able to 'save the book' to my profile or bookpage. I will also need a profile page describing who I am as a reader.]


## Integrations

*Use of an API is expected. This can be 3rd party APIs, your own API, or a combination of data sets. Identify which integrations are planned for and outline how you will use them transformatively. For 3rd party APIs provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*

[For this application I will be using an API from Internet Archive. This API gives access to all of the book on the digital pubic library and can be searched by book name, author, subjects, covers and a few other ways as well. This will be helpful for the user of this application to search the book they are looking for. (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)]

## Change Order
* Confirm the proposal document summarizes the project scope: YES
  
* Describe how much work is left to do: At least a month of work is left.
  
* List and describe any proposed changes to the original project scope: I do not feel any changes are necessary at this point. I have not dove deep with the coding process yet and may feel like a change could be needed then but not as of this stage in the development process.

### Week 1

<br>
🌵 Challenges - I am still having some challenges with my branch on VS code not adding to my github. I tried a few more things with no luck. Since there is not an error it is hard to figure out how to get it to synch with github.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I feel like I am making great progess on my frontend. I feel like I am ahead of my plan for having that part done. I hope I will get to start on the backend sooner than I thought because I think that part will take me much longer to complete.

🔮 Next Steps - I plan on reviewing all my front end and editing anything that still needs attention. I will also add the buttons and functionality to those if I have the extra time this week.

### Week 3

<br>
🌵 Challenges - I had some challenges with styling the buttons this week. I had to do some research on how to get them to look the way I wanted them too. I did end up figuring it out and like the way they came out. The next challenge will be to get them functioning.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - This week I feel great about where I am overall in the front end part of my project. I feel confident that I will have the whole front end completed by next week! I also feel great about how my site looks.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I will be working on the finishing touches to the front end this week along with getting help for my Github issue. I will also be adding a logo to my header that I did not do previously.
